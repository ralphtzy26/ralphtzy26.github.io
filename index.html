        <p>Hello! My name is Ralph Anthony C. Abad, and I am a first-year Information Technology student at Silliman University. I am excited about this course because my goal is to become a software engineer. Although I am still working on improving my coding skills, I am committed to learning and growing so that I can achieve success in the future and work for various IT companies. Once successful, I aspire to travel to different places and collaborate with major companies worldwide.</p>
