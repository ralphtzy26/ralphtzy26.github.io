	<h1>About Myself</h1>
	<p>Hi, I am Ralph Anthony C. Abad, 19 years old, from Bayawan City. 
I graduated from Foundation Preparatoy Academy; I am a photographer and also the president of the multimedia club at my previous school.
 My hobbies are playing online games, watching Netflix, and reading books. I also love playing football since that was my sport when I was the age of 6. 
 I played a lot of tournaments, but sadly I got injured, and my parents stopped me from playing again because I was diagnosed with chronic osteomyelitis or
 infection of the bone. When I finish college I want to travel to differents country like, japan, korea, switzerland, and maldives.</p>



<p>I like to hang out with my friends in my free time because I like their humor and they are so funny. 
We always play online games during our free time. We also participated in the ROTC program, and it was so good because it was like we were training like military.
I want to meet more people here in Silliman and be friends with them to make my college life a lot more enjoyable.
 I am focusing on studying my major subjects because I don't have enough knowledge about coding.
 I want to explore this course because my plan was to work as a freelancer soon.</p>
