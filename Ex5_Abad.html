 <p>Sometimes we make the process more complicated than we need to. We will never make a
journey of a thousand miles by fretting about how long it will take or how hard it will be. We
make the journey by taking each day step by step and then repeating it again and again until we
reach our destination.</p>

 <p>I'm convinced of this: Good done anywhere is good done everywhere. For a change, start by
speaking to people rather than walking by them like they're stones that don't matter. As long as
you're breathing, it's never too late to do some good deeds. Do it now, do it today and see the
difference.</p>
